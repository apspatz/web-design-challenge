          <p>From the data, Raleigh overall is a pretty safe city to live in. The vast majority of crimes committed in the city are nonviolent crimes, such as theft or drug possession. Even in the, what would be considered, most dangerous parts of the city, particularly violent crimes like sexual assaults and murders are rare. The category "Deceased Person" includes any crime scene with a deceased person for any reason, including self-inflicted and accidental deaths. The category "Missing Person" includes missing adults, missing minors, and runaways. The category "Other Crime" is a catchall for other nonviolent crimes, such as drug posession and theft of property.</p>

          <p>From this data, it is clear that the Southeast district of Raleigh sees the most crime. This area is known for having some of the lowest socioeconomic activity in the city, so it follows that crime would be more likely to occur in this district. That said,taking a closer look at the data shows that the vast majority of the crimes committed in this district are nonviolent or missing persons.</p>

          <p>With such a small dataset, it is difficult to make any truly verifiable conclusions about crime in Raleigh over long periods of time. However, looking at this snapshot, it seems pretty clear that the crime rate in the city doesn't change much year-to-year, with an average rate of approximately 500 crimes committed annually.</p>
